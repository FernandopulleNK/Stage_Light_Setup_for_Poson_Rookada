# Stage_Light_Setup_for_Poson_Rookada
 - Even at a young age, I was very passionate about electronics. In 2015, when I was in grade 10, I lacked the resources to learn electronics formally. However, due to my deep interest, I undertook numerous electronic projects despite my limited knowledge of electronics and electrical engineering.
 - In 2015, during 'Poson,' two of my friends and I planned to create a 'Poson Rookada' item. For that purpose, I designed a stage light setup to illuminate our 'rookada'.
